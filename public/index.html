            <h1>Cache-key variations on Netlify</h1>

            <p>Cache-key variations are a powerful new tool in your arsenal.
            This entire page is served on the root URL with the help of
            cached Netlify Edge Functions and Cache-key variations.</p>

            <p><strong>This response in particular was not served from our
                cache.</strong></p>

            <p>It's seems that this is the first time you've visited this site.
            We know this because we're setting a cookie on your browser (sorry),
            and we're varying the content based on one of the keys of that cookie!</p>

            <p>It also seems like you're the first person from <Country> to
            visit our site! We know this because Netlify does geolocation based
            off your IP address, and we're also varying based on geolocation!</p>

            <p>How about we play a game?</p>

            <p>How many kilometers deep do you think it is the Mariana Trench?</p>
